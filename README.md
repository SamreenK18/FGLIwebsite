# FGLIwebsite
a website for first-generation low income students to access resources and connect with fellow fgli students as well share their own experiences.

# Encouragement
Studying abroad can be a life-changing adventure, especially for students who might not think it's possible. That's why we created Student Connect: to be your guide to exploring new worlds, gaining independence, and discovering your full potential. We’re here to help students like you – with big dreams but limited resources – turn your aspirations into reality.. 

# What we Do
Our website aims to level the playing field for millions of students aspiring to study abroad. By providing comprehensive information about exams, scholarships, and internships at universities worldwide, we empower students from any background, like someone dreaming of Harvard without ever setting foot in New York, to turn their aspirations into reality.

# How We Built It 
CSS: formatting
JavaScript
HTML
PHP: server-side scripting
Xampp: to store user data

# Challenges Faced by Our Team
Mastering a fresh framework and database system for our website took a lot of effort. Building the backend part of our website was tricky, and we're still figuring out the best way to manage user data. 

# What’s Next
We look forward to adding more resources, filtering blog data by content type, adding media to blogs and creating a more responsive user page. We aim to keep on updating the website time-to-time to keep up with new resources.
